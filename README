Both the psend and precv directories have little build scripts
called 'm'.  ( Stands for 'make', although they are not make files. )

Both dirs also have little run scripts called ... wait for it ... 'r'.

Both build scripts assume that your Proton is installed in /usr , not
/usr/local .

When you run the test, start the receiver first.

The sender will print out a timestamp just before it sends 
the first message.  The receiver will print out a timestamp 
just after it receives the last message.


The sender and receiver are locked onto separate processors.
( numbers 1 and 2. )


The sender and receiver memory footprints grow relatively slowly 
now, after I fixed a large dumb leak in my code.
