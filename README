Both the psend and precv directories have little build scripts
called 'm'.  ( Stands for 'make', although they are not make files. )

Both dirs also have little run scripts called ... wait for it ... 'r'.

Both build scripts assume that your Proton is installed in /usr , not
/usr/local .

When you run the test, start the receiver first.

The sender will print out a timestamp just before it sends 
the first message.  The receiver will print out a timestamp 
just after it sends the last message.


Right now, the sender shuts down with an error
message, because I am not shutting something down
correctly.  Later.

Also, the sender memory footprint grows rapidly, so 
I can't do tests much bigger than the 5 million messages 
that the run scripts call for right now.  Later.
